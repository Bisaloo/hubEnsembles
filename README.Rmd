The goal of hubEnsembles is to provide standard implementations of commonly used methods for ensembling model outputs. The hubEnsembles package is part of [the hubverse project](https://hubdocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and expects all input data to the key functions to be formatted as an object of a [`model_out_tbl` class](https://infectious-disease-modeling-hubs.github.io/hubUtils/reference/as_model_out_tbl.html). 

## Installation

You can install the development version of hubEnsembles using this code:

``` r
remotes::install_github("infectious-disease-modeling-hubs/hubEnsembles")
```


<!--
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(hubEnsembles)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
